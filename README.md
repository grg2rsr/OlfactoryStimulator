# A high-bandwidth dual-channel olfactory stimulator for studying temporal sensitivity of olfactory processing 
## Description
This repository contains files associated to the publication [_A high-bandwidth dual-channel olfactory stimulator for studying temporal sensitivity of olfactory processing_](https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/42/2/141/2709444), Georg Raiser, C.Giovanni Galizia and Paul Szyszka, Chemical Senses 2016, doi: 10.1093/chemse/bjw114 

The files contain the technical information for the construction of the olfactory stimulator that we have developed.

## File description

### CAD Files
1. `body.ipt` - the main body of the olfactormeter
2. `nozzle_big.ipt` - inner nozzle, small diameter
3. `nozzle_small.ipt` - inner nozzle, large diameter
4. `holder.ipt` - A mount

the other CAD files are rather generic (glass tubes, a holding rod, a model for the valve for the technical drawing) but needed of the `Assembly.iam`.
Currently, the files are in Autodesk Inventor `.ipt` and `.iam` format. Upload of other formats will follow, if anything specific is requested please write me a mail.

### Schematics
1. `Valve_control_circuit_layout.pdf`
2. `Valve_control_circuit_schematics.pdf`
